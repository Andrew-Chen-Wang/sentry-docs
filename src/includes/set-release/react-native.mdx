You will also need to past a distribution to `dist` for events to correctly be attributed to a release. Usually this value is the build number, for example `52`. This value only needs to be unique to each release.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  release: "my-project-name@2.3.12",
  dist: "52",
});
```
