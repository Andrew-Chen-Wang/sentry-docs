You will also need to past a distribution to `dist` for events to correctly be attributed to a release. Usually this value is the build number, for example `52`. This value only needs to be unique to each release.

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  release: "my-project-name@2.3.12",
  dist: "52",
});
```

<Alert level="info" title="Source Maps">

When you set the `release` and `dist` in a React Native app, the automatic source maps upload script will no longer work, you will have to [manually upload sourcemaps](/platforms/react-native/sourcemaps).
