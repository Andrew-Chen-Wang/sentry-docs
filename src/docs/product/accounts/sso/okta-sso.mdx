1. For "1. General Settings", no special settings are needed.

1. For "2. Sign On Options", fill in these fields as follows:

   - Base URL: `https://sentry.io`

      - Important: There should not be a trailing slash at the end of the URL as it will break the redirect from Okta to Sentry.

   - Organization Slug: *YOUR_ORG_SLUG*

      - You can find your organization slug in the URL: `https://sentry.io/organizations/YOUR_ORG_SLUG/`

   - Email: `Email`

1. Sentry will attempt to authenticate and link your account with Okta. After successful authentication, you'll be redirected to Sentry's SSO configuration page, where you can take the following actions:

   - You can share the "Login URL" value, which will be used for SP-initiated SSO, with the users in your organization.

   - Scroll down to the bottom and ensure that "Require SSO" is checked if you want to enforce logging in with Okta.

   - Set a "Default Role" for new SSO users. Selecting "Member" should cover most use-cases.

   - If you made changes, click "Save Settings" to complete your setup.

## SCIM Integration

Sentry users can manage provisioning using Okta with SCIM. You'll need to have Okta SSO set up and configured for your organization already. Sentry supports the following operations:
- Create users
- Deactivate users
- Group push
- Import groups
